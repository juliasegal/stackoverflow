# WorldRemit Android Coding Task

## Instructions

Your task is developing an app that lists top StackOverflow users and presenting some details about them.

Enclosed is the half (actually less than half) implemented project for the app, which:

- needs some work in the codebase
- needs some work for UI
- might need some re-work/refactoring
- might have some bugs

Goal is finishing the app according to the specifications below and the designs shown in the screenshots, 
but total time you should spend on the task is limited to 3 hours. Since it's not possible to finish the task completely in 3 hours,
please prioritise your work and do things that you find as the most important first.

- When the app is launched, it lists the top 100 StackOverflow users as shown in the [first screenshot](user_list.png)
- When a user is tapped, details of that user is shown as in the [second screenshot](user_details.png)
- App locally simulates follow/block functionality without any calls to an API.
- When a user is blocked, details of that user can't be seen.
- When a user is followed, "follow" indication can be seen on the user's detail screen.
- App supports both portrait and landscape modes.
- App handles the edge cases and the use cases that you would expect from an actual production app.

Your priorities and decisions are important, so please explain them in a few sentences.
Please also explain, your additions, changes and fixes to the project codebase and UI.
And finally what would you work on next or change about the functionality or UI if you had more time?

When you finish the task, please make a zip of the project and upload it to the link in the email invite.
